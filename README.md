## Secret/Glitched Color (Fortegreen) ##
The secret color is a lighter version of the dark green, in lobbies chat normally won't work, you can't customize your character. People also see your name as "???".  
In game, your dead body will be red, in meetings you'll be red and in chat you'll be red.
Therefore there can be 3 greens and 2 reds, and I believe if multiple people have a different color value above 12, there can be multiple glitched greens (Untested).

## Information for those interested: ##  

There were originally a bunch more commits (50+ lost) but I messed up and forced my whole workspace and it messed everything up  

Custom names that include "\\", ")" or "\[" will result in a "Banned from Room" message and you also cannot include "," in your name as it breaks the file.  
Names longer than 10 characters will also not work in online games, local play lets you make a lobby but I'm not sure if others can join.
